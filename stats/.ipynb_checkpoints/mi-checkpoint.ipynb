    "\n",
    "Mutual information is a measure of the reduction in uncertainty for one variable given a known value of another variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I(X,Y)=H(X)-H(X|Y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $I(X,Y)$ is the mutual information for $X$ and $Y$, $H(X)$ is the entropy for $X$, $H(X|Y)$ is the conditional entropy for $X$ given $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual information is symmetric:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I(X,Y)=I(Y,X)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual information can be calculated as the KL divergence between the joint distribution and the product of marginal probabilities for each variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I(X,Y)=KL(P(X,Y)||P(X)\\times P(Y))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual information and information gain are computed equivalently, and therefore MI is sometimes used as as a synonym for information gain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$IG(S,a)=H(S)-H(S|a)$$"
